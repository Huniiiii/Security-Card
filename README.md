# Security-Card

It is a security center. The security center only accepts Visa cards, MasterCard credit cards, American Express cards and Discover cards. The rest are invalid for the security center. We will collect the user's name, age, password and card number by inputting. For security, we will hide the password to prevent the password from being exposed after disclosure. Finally, we will write in a text file for all users.
